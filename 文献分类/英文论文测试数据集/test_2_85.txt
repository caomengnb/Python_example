**摘要**
In this paper, the stabilization problems of two- dimensional symmetric bilinear systems by constant controls are considered. Both the continuous-time case and the discrete- time case are studied and necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilization of the systems are presented. It is shown that if the control is multiple then the continuous-time system is stabilizable if and only if its discrete-time counterpart is stabilizable.
